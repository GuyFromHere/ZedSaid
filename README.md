# ZedSaid
A simple web page to help me keep track of the ridiculous things my daughter says to me. She's been teasing me like this for as long as she could speak. I wish I had started this sooner because I've forgotten so many of them already.

Check it out [here!](https://guyfromhere.github.io/ZedSaid/)

# Concept

This started as a database app deployed to Heroku but the page kept crashing so I ported it back to static HTML.
